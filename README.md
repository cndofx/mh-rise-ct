# MHR: Sunbreak Cheat Table

Very early work in progress still, many things may be broken. Back up your save before use, I'm not responsible for any lost or corrupted save data.

## Main Features

- "Export Charms" script for [mhrise.wiki-db.com](https://mhrise.wiki-db.com/sim/?hl=en)
- "Charm Editor" script with a GUI
- "Add Items" script that will spawn items directly into your storage box
- "Zero Crafting Requirements" for equipment and "Bypass Decoration Crafting Requirements" scripts

## Credits

- Cypher121's [mhrise_charm_exporter](https://github.com/Cypher121/mhrise_charm_exporter) (now outdated) for information on reading charms from memory
